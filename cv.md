## Summary 
I have started my career in TV production company and had a great success in the field of
event management. However, I felt that I wanted to pursue a career related to my educational
background and I chosen to teach children and get involved into the projects with
underprivileged kids.

Currently I am looking for an opportunity to move outside my comfort area and am especially
interested in the field of IT. To the table I bring excellent communications skills, ability to
multitask and perform well in stressful situations. I am fast learner and have ability to work
both individually and as part of the team.

freelance projects - wherever they had the opportunity to demonstrate skills they have.
Also it would be awesome if you add links to source code)
